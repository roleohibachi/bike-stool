# build-bike-stool
A stool made from the rear triange and seat of a discarded bike
## requirements
- [X] Bike frame
-- Found abandoned bike
-- Failed at cracking 1/2 combo locks
-- hacksawed top tube
-- removed all components (incl crank w/ help from local co-op). Bottom bracket still in place.
- [ ] 2x4
- [ ] casters/feet
- attachment hardware
  - [X] wood screws
  - [ ] rear axle (threaded rod through dropouts, center supported)
  - [ ] front "axle" (threaded rod thru BB, ends supported)
## design
Use a similar triangular design to the target frames built in Hawaii. Triangle points forward. 1x 45 degree cut across 2x4 makes the bottom layer, where the BB and front foot will mount. 2x4 laid across the top provides an elevated platform for the rear mounting.
