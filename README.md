# bike-stool
A stool made from the rear triange and seat of a discarded bike
## requirements
- [X] Bike frame
-- Found abandoned bike
-- Failed at cracking 1/2 combo locks
-- hacksawed top tube
-- removed all components (incl crank w/ help from local co-op). Bottom bracket still in place.
- [ ] 2x4
- [ ] casters/feet
- attachment hardware
  - [X] wood screws
  - [ ] rear axle (threaded rod through dropouts, center supported)
  - [ ] front "axle" (threaded rod thru BB, ends supported)
## design
Use a similar triangular design to the target frames built in Hawaii. Triangle points forward. 1x 45 degree cut across 2x4 makes the bottom layer, where the BB and front foot will mount. 2x4 laid across the top provides an elevated platform for the rear mounting.
- [X] upload sketch
## Build
I went to a friend's place to build it. He's got spare fence boards, posts, and some wood tools. It quickly became apparent that:
- There is no need to use skewers. Just bolt the rear triangle to a wood block of appropriate width (~130mm)
- It is plenty stable on a single fence board, no triangle shape is needed.
- The front does not need to be anchored, and in fact, it's kind of fun to lean on!

Then I used a rotary tool to shorten the exposed tubing, round off the edges, and wirebrush the inside. The top tube was left long enough to hold pens and pencils, but the bottom tube was cut off at the bottom bracket. 

## Future
- nice wood and some cleanup of the bike parts
- adjust saddle back. Maybe swap saddle for a nicer one.
- remove BB leaving just the shell
- polish/hone the seatpost to slide easier
- Sit in it
